# Notes
# Any site can set cookies with a variety of properties -- the most important of these for today's task are the name and value of the cookies, both of which will always be set. It's worth noting that a site can only access cookies that are associated with its own domain (i.e. google.com can't access any cookies stored by tryhackme.com, and vice versa).
